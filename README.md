# Representing graphs in python with networkx

## Graphs : 
a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).


## Coding graphs : 
there are many languages that provide solutions to code graph nodes and edges , like C, java, and python (like most of the time) does that too , but with his simple understanding and syntax.


## NetworkX : 
NetworkX is a Python library for the study of complex networks, such as social networks, transportation networks, biological networks, and more. It provides tools for the analysis of network structure, dynamics, and function, as well as for the creation, manipulation, and visualization of networks.

NetworkX includes a wide range of algorithms for various tasks related to network analysis.
